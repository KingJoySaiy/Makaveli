### 3.1 Invert completely

* [There be + n. + prep.]

eg. There is no gap between mind and matter.

### 3.2 Invert partly

* Negative adv. or phrase locates at the beginning of the sentence

eg. Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system.

* "Only" locates at the beginning of the sentence

eg. **Only** over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up.

* Virtual statement without "if"

eg. But had he kept his word, that debate would be beside the point. 

=> But if he had kept his word...

## Ⅳ. Virtual statement

### 4.1 If virtual

| time            | "if" subordinate clause                   | main clause         |

| presume past    | had done                                  | would + have done   |
| presume present | did / were                                | could / should + do |
| presume future  | (did / were) / (were to do) / (should do) | might + do          |

eg. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have progressed.

### 4.2 Virtual in Noun clause

* [Non-predicate v. + object clause]

| not only...but (... / ...as well / also...) | ...whereas...   |           |





## Ⅲ. Inverted sentences

### 3.1 Invert completely

* <u>There be + n. + prep.</u>

eg. There is no gap between mind and matter.

### 3.2 Invert partly

* Negative adv. or phrase locates at the beginning of the sentence

eg. Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system.

* "Only" locates at the beginning of the sentence

eg. Only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up.

* Virtual statement without "if"

eg. But had he kept his word, that debate would be beside the point. 

=> But if he had kept his word...

## Ⅳ. Virtual statement

### 4.1 If virtual

| time            | "if" subordinate clause                   | main clause         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| presume past    | had done                                  | would + have done   |
| presume present | did / were                                | could / should + do |
| presume future  | (did / were) / (were to do) / (should do) | might + do          |

eg. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have progressed.

### 4.2 Virtual in Noun clause

* If main clause expressed "suggestion, command or demand", then predicate should use "(should) + v." like this sentence itself. (=_=)

## Ⅴ. Noun clause

### 5.1 Object clause

* <u>v. + object clause</u>

eg. Scientists **believe** that intelligence can expand and fluctuate according to mental effort.

* <u>prep. + object clause</u>

eg. This and other similar cases raise the question **of** whether there is still a line between the court politics.

* <u>Non-predicate v. + object clause</u>

eg. You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.

* clause put to the end and "it" used as formal object

eg. That kind of activity makes **it** less likely that the court's decisions will be accepted as impartial judgments.

### 5.2 Predicative clause

* almost the same as object clause, generally used after linking verb such as "be, become, remains"

eg. Part of the problem **is** that the justice are not  bound by an ethics code.

### 5.3 Subject clause

* " **That / What / Whether** " used as subject, "it" could used as formal object

eg. What was done in the experiment did not matter.

=> It did not matter what was done in the experiment.

* <u>It be done that...</u> / <u>It be adj. / n. that...</u>

### 5.4  Appositive clause

* used after abstract n. to explain it

eg. Evidence **that** the love life program produces lasting changes is limited and mixing.

* Abstract nouns

idea, opinion, fact, evidence, question, doubt, reason, theory, belief, possibility, chance, hope, contention, guarantee...

## Ⅵ. Attributive clause

### 6.1 Relational word
| Antecedent word                     | Relational word                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| sth.                                | which / that                      |
| sb.                                 | who / whom (sb. is object) / that |
| (sth. / sb.) has "own relationship" | whose                             |
| time                                | when                              |
| location                            | where                             |
| reason                              | why                               |

### 6.2 Attention

* The relational word must used as a part of the sentence **including "that"**  .

* If relational word were used as object, it could be removed.

eg. Are humans actually aware of the world they live in?

* whereby = by which

eg. The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has traditionally been the method **whereby** many intellectuals earn their living.

* <u>when / while / as / before / after / since / until...</u>

eg. As the brain fades, we refer to these occurrences as "senior moments".

* <u>as soon as / by the time...</u>

eg. By the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late.

### 7.2 **Reason**

* <u>because / since / as / now that...</u>

eg. Now that you have developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out whatever outline you have made.

### 7.5 **Concession**

* <u>although / though / even though / even if / while...</u>

eg. The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be.

### 7.6 Other unimportant type of adverbial clause

* **Location** : <u>where...</u>
* **Intention** : <u>so that / in order that...</u>
* **Comparison** : <u>as ... as... / -er than / more...than</u>
* **Manner** : <u>as / as if...(means "similar to")</u>

### 7.7 usage of "as"

* means <u>"when / while"</u> in time adverbial clause (important)
* means <u>"because"</u> in reason adverbial clause (important)
* means <u>"compare to"</u> in comparison adverbial clause
* means <u>"in the manner of"</u> in manner adverbial clause

## Ⅷ . Break complex sentence

### 8.1 Find conjunction

* parallel conjunction: <u>and / but / or...</u>
* subordinate conjunction : <u>because / if / while / although...</u>
*  Relational conjunction : <u>that / how / what / who / where / which / why...</u>

### 8.2 Find the position of the clause's end

* clause ends at punctuation

eg. One of the reasons <u>why the appointment came as such a surprise</u>, **however,** <u>is that Gilbert is comparatively little known</u>.

* clause ends at the next conjunction

eg. That whispered message, half invitation and half forcing, is <u>**what** most of us think of **when** we hear the words "peer pressure".</u>

* clause ends before the second predicate

eg. The majority of people <u>who use networked computers to upload</u> **are** not even aware of the significance of <u>what they are doing.</u>

### 8.3 Analyze subject and predicate

* sub. + pred. + sub. + pred.

eg. **Allen's contribution** <u>was to take an assumption</u> **we** <u>all share</u>...and reveal its erroneous nature.

* sub. + sub. + pred. + pred.

eg. **The way consumers** now <u>approach</u> the process of making purchase decisions <u>means</u> that marketing's impact stems from a broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.

## Ⅸ . Simplify complex sentence

### 9.1 Find predicate verb

### 9.2 Remove decorations and find the core

* core part: <u>subject / predicate verb / object / complement...</u>

* unimportant part: <u>adjective / adverb / prepositional phrase / inserted phrase...</u>

eg. **The decision** <u>of the New York Philharmonic</u> <u>to hire Alan Gilbert</u> <u>as its next music director</u> **has been the talk** <u>of the classical-music world</u> <u>ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009.</u>

eg. A string of **accidents**, <u>including the partial collapse of a cooling tower in 2007 and the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage</u>, **raised serious questions** <u>about both Vermont Yankee's safety and Entergy's management</u> -- **especially** <u>after the company made misleading statements</u> **about the pipe**.
